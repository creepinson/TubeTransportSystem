# Routing
There are two tiers of Tube Routers: basic, and advanced.

The **basic** router is a block that will route any entities that go through it to a destination tube
that is selected in the router GUI and conencted to the network. 

The **advanced** tube router is more customizable then the basic router.
It allows you to specify a time to keep routing entities before switching to the *default* destination. 
The advanced router can also be configured to change to another destination after the timer has ended
instead of using the default.
